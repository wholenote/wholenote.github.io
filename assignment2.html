    <h1>Common Themes</h1>
    <h2>Why we are taking this class:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            There are lots of similarities between the many reasons. One of the obvious reasons comes from the curiousity about the way technology effects media.
            In addition, other people took the class because it is unique in the TAMU computer science cirriculum.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Media:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>YouTube</b>: A common video media type was YouTube. It may be one of the most popular video streaming services of our times because of the many different types
            and quantities of content on YouTube's platform. Examples: <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~andrewwhitman/newMedia.html">Andrew</a>,
            <a href="https://mcsandovall.github.io/assigment1.html">Mario</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/csce656chiayuanchang">Chia-Yuan</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Video Games</b>: A ton of students mentioned video games in their media consumption. People mainly consumed their games through two platforms, the desktop
            computer or the console. Some gave specific examples that included games from many genres such as RPG, Action, and Fantasy games. Examples: 
            <a href="https://dylantheriot.com/#/656">Dylan</a>, <a href="http://45.56.76.233/CSCE445">Chris</a>, <a href="https://people.tamu.edu/~rob.hinck/656.html">Rob</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Email</b>: Naturally, lots of people listed email as one of their communication media. Email is such a common method of commmuncation that it is almost 
            unavoidable as a communication method. It seemed that Gmail was very common among our class. Examples:

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Music</b>: Another common media used among our class was listening to music. Lots of people enjoy listening to music so it was not suprising to see that
            many people in our class enjoy it as well. Some students listed specific genres and it seemed almost all genres were covered. Examples:
